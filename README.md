# Tic-tac-toe

After completing the udemy course on C++, I decided to challenge myself to apply what I have learned into making a Tic-tac-toe game, but the fun part is that you can make a square game board of any size( dimension x dimension). 

I made the algorithms fully compatible with any provided board size. I also challenged myself to use OOP paradigm instead of functional programming. 

Overal, it was a fun aproject and really helped me put what I have learned into practice:))
